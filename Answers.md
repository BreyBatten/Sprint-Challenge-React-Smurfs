1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Server-side routing is the traditional method of pulling in and displaying content to the page. We request info from a server, and that server sends us back that info. The page refreshes to display the new information. Server side routing's big pro is that it doesn't have to load the whole page, only the information that is requested. Client side routing is the newer way of doing things. With client-side routing, the page doesn't refresh because everything is included in one page, we just see the information we have requested.

2.  What does HTTP stand for?

HyperText Transfer Protocol

3.  What does CRUD stand for?

Create, Read, Update, Delete

4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

.then() and .catch(). .then() is the 'happy route' or the route that is taken when there are no errors, and .catch() is the 'unhappy path' that handles any errors.

5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests

POST, PUT, DELETE. Post is the 'create' part of the CRUD acronym, PUT is the 'update', and DELETE is the 'delete'.
